# Frontend of Cinemaxxx
This project will serve as a proof of concept for the organization Cinema-xx.


## Frontend hosted link : 
http://cinemaxxx.surge.sh/ (https doesn't work with the api because our backend is hosted on http)
 
 
## Backend hosted link : 
http://54.221.49.14:9090/


## Who focused on what parts:
- Chiara = first layer of code, connecting to the api, routing and movies list.
- Gloria = main page and about page, connecting to the api.
- Patrik = hosting the backend properly, connecting to the api.
- Samuel = timetable and connecting to the api.


## Sprints and planning
 - 1st Sprint

***Technical***
•    Hosted backend - 0,5 story points
•    Hosted frontend - 0,5 story points
•    Setting up Github - 0,5 story points
•    Check end points and make sure backend and frontend can communicate together. - 2 story points

***Story points with backlog tasks***
•    As a administrator I want to be able to add and edit timtables of movies, so that customers can chose their movies and employees can set everything up in time. - (Add, edit movies, schedule times for specific movies in specific theater halls.) - 6 story points (STATUS: NOT COMPLETED, problems with organizing the data retrieved from the api).
•    As a customer I want to be able to view timetables of movies, to choose a time of viewing, that best suits me. - (Let users see all movies playing today, in this week, or a period.) - 6 story points  (STATUS: NOT COMPLETED, the user can only view a list of the movies that are playing)
•    As a customer I want to be able to quickly find information about movies that are playing and the cinema, so I can pick a movie and find out basic information about the cinema - (Create a welcome page showing info about both the cinema and the movies playing.) - 3 story points (STATUS: NOT COMPLETED, the user can only view which movies are playing and info about the cinema).
